# sdf_2d_slam - 2D SDF tracker implementation

## Basic SDF Tracker
- [x] 2D odom and 3d sensor data collection in Stage simulator
- [x] Scripts for extracting data from collected rosbags
- [x] Implement creating a sdf map using a single scan and visualize
- [x] Implement sdf fusion using true pose and create map
- [x] Implement sdf tracking

## Semantics Incorporation
- [x] Augment laser scan with semantics labels
- [ ] Build semantic map from sdf tracker
- [ ] Implement semantics-incorporated tracking optimization
